BALANCING
GRIDLOCK
If you've ever stepped on a Lego...this hurts worse.

By making her gadget a bit more enjoyable to use, we're looking to make Gridlock players' lives a bit easier.

Lowered Gridlock's Caltrop deployment time to 9s (down from 13s).
Lowered the individual Caltrops deployment time to 0.45s (down from 0.7s).
Lowered the range of random deploy variation to 0.05s (down from 0.1s).
Added a delay of 0.45s before the deployment sequence starts (previously no delay).
ORYX
The Rainbow üêê has goat to dash.

We want to let Oryx make more use of his dash, and added mobility and durability will hopefully make him a bit more fun to play.

Using his dash through a soft wall will not deplete all the dash charges.
Increased Dash refresh time to 12s (up from 8s).
Dash recovery time for all dashes is now 0.5s. (Previous recovery times: soft wall = 1s, enemy = 0.7s).
FUZE
Hide the hostages!

Giving Fuze a bit more presence and utility with an additional charge.

Increased the number of cluster charges to 4 (up from 3)
GAMEPLAY
PUSHBACK MECHANICS
To maintain consistency with softwall interactions, we're giving enemies that are pushed through walls the same feedback as when Oryx dashes through them.

When pushed through a wall by Nomad's airjabs or Oryx's dash, players will receive the same feedback and rtake the same damage (5 hp) as when Oryx dashes through a soft wall.
BUG FIXES
FIXED ‚Äì Missing anchoring decals from Ace's SELMA.
FIXED ‚Äì Ace's SELMA can get stuck when thrown in a certain way at some beams, becoming unrecoverable.
FIXED ‚Äì While grappling through a window or hatch, Amaru can aim faster with her LMG if she times her sprint and ADS buttons just prior to landing.

GAME UPDATES
MATCH CANCELLATION
Match Cancellation will go live with the Y5S2.1 update! We have tested it on the TS and as well as internally against a number of potential circumstances. However as it is a new feature, please let us know if you have any feedback or issues to report with Match Cancellation at r6fix.ubi.com.

Match Cancellation is a new feature that will allow players to cancel their current Ranked match under the condition that team sizes are unbalanced at the beginning of the match (eg: if players disconnect before the first round, or if a lobby is formed with less than 10 players). The Match Cancellation vote option will become available for the incomplete team during the prep phase and a majority vote will cancel the match. A canceled match will show as canceled and have no impact on MMR.

Abandon penalties are still in place and players who abandon an ongoing Ranked Match are still subject to escalating abandon sanctions.

If a match cancellation vote is triggered, leaving before the validation of the Match Cancellation vote will also result in an abandon penalty. Players should remain in the game until the Match Cancellation vote is validated and the game has been canceled.
